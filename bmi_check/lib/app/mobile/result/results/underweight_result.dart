      "You are underweight! Being underweight is just as unhealthy as being overweight. This index can be caused by different factors. It can be a voluntary decision, such as food deprivation, or eating behavior disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. In addition, lack of weight can be caused by metabolic diseases such as hyperthyroidism or diabetes, parasites, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's Syndrome, food intolerances or liver disease. Psychic factors, such as stress, can also cause a lack of appetite.";
